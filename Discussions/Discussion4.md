The purpose of the UWP platform is to build and run highly interactive applications with continuously connected, touch-driven user interfaces and support for embedded device sensors.

2.Describe two ways you can set and modify the properties of controls.
You can set and modify the properties of controls using the Properties window or by typing the equivalent XAML markup into the XAML window.

3.Describe the two layout schemes of UWP apps that we constructed in class.
The tabular layout was designed for devices with a wider screen. The columnar layout was designed for devices with a narrow screen.

4.Describe three ways you can use the Visual State Manager to adapt the layout of UWP apps.
Triggers can be used to alert the Visual State Manager when certain aspects of the display changes.The visual state transitions performed by these triggers can be described in the XAML markup of your app. The Visual State Manager can move controls around, display, or hide controls based on the visual state.
