2.How does Entity Framework work?
The Microsoft ADO.NET Entity Framework is an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that enables developers to work with relational data as domain-specific objects, eliminating the need for most of the data access plumbing code that developers usually need to write.

3.What is the difference between the code-first and the database-first approaches to developing UWP apps?
In code first approach we will first create entity classes with properties defined in it. Entity framework will create the database and tables based on the entity classes defined. So database is generated from the code. When the dot net code is run database will get created.In this approach Database and tables are created first. Then you create entity Data Model using the created database.
